Platform :- Codeforces 
Contest :- Codeforces Round 744 Div 3
Approach :- We consider each point having '*' to be mid point and from there we try to go to left diagonally upward and similarly right diagonally upward , if we are able to get a 
            valid tick of size > k then we mark all the cells of grid , at the end we check if all the point of grid having '*' are marked or not , if marked we print "yes" else "NO"
