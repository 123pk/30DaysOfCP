Approach :- This problems also can be solved by just analysing the problem , it states that we want permutation of string with atmost 'n' palindromic substring , 
           you should know that stirng of 1 character is a palindrome so a given string already have atleast 'n' palindromes , so you want to arrange elements such that we 
           don't have palindrome of size>1 ,which can be done by arraning stirng in some pattern like this "123123.." or "213213.. etc , so max answer is '6' when we have count of all unque character equal
           as there are 3 unique characters atmax our string can have and all different permutaion of 3 character is 3! = 6.
